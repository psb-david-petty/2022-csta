# Problem

Describe problem here&hellip;

- Nothing outside of the `<body>` tag will be included in the [CodeCheck](http://horstmann.com/).
- Everything below this point is typical boilerplate for [APCS](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) [CodeCheck](http://horstmann.com/)s.

<!-- APCS BOILERPLATE -->

Include an initial comment with an `@author YOUR NAME <your@email.address>` line in all solution files.

<!-- /**/ EXPLANATION -->

<hr style="border-top: thin solid gray; background: none;">

**Note**: In [APCS](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) free-response-question [CodeCheck](http://horstmann.com/)s there may be code on lines with a `/**/` comment in the leftmost column &mdash; like this:

<pre style="margin-left: 1.5em; border-left: thin solid gray; padding-left: 0.5em;">   // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
/**/private String word;
/**/public HiddenWord(String word) { this.word = word; }
/**/public int length() { return this.word.length(); }</pre>

Any code on lines with a `/**/` comment in the leftmost column has been added by the [CodeCheck](http://horstmann.com/) author(s) and is outside the scope of the APCS free-response question. That code is necessary to complete or test the program(s) and should not be modified, but there may be other valid implementations. Consequently, your solution *cannot make assumptions about, nor make use of the knowledge of, any particular implementation of the added code*.
